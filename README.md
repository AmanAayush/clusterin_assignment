# Clustering Assignment

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for a clustering assignment using PyCaret. The assignment involves implementing three clustering algorithms (K-means, MeanShift, and Hierarchical Clustering) and plotting 3D graphs for visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this assignment is Taxi Trip Fare Prediction. This dataset contains The Taxi Trip Fare Prediction dataset typically contains information about taxi trips, including attributes such as trip duration, pickup and dropoff locations, number of passengers, and the fare amount. This dataset is commonly used in machine learning and data science projects to predict taxi trip fares based on various features.

Here's a brief description of the attributes commonly found in a Taxi Trip Fare Prediction dataset:

Trip Duration: The duration of the taxi trip in seconds or minutes.
Pickup Time: The date and time when the taxi trip started.
Dropoff Time: The date and time when the taxi trip ended.
Pickup Location: Latitude and longitude coordinates or address of the pickup location.
Dropoff Location: Latitude and longitude coordinates or address of the dropoff location.
Passenger Count: The number of passengers in the taxi during the trip.
Fare Amount: The fare amount charged for the taxi trip.
Additional Charges: Any additional fees or charges added to the fare amount.
Total Amount: The total fare amount including additional charges.
Payment Type: The payment method used for the taxi trip (cash, credit card, etc.).
This dataset can be used for various tasks such as regression to predict the fare amount based on trip attributes, classification to predict payment type, or clustering to identify patterns in taxi trip data.I used this dataset for clustering.

 Additionally, data cleaning and feature engineering may be necessary to prepare the dataset for modeling tasks.
## Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
3. Install the required libraries by running:

## Code Structure
- `clustering_assignment.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the clustering assignment.
- `data/`: Taxi Trip Fare Prediction.
- `plots/`: 3D plots.

## Implementation
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Load the dataset.
- Perform any necessary data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.

### 2. Clustering Algorithms
- Implement K-means clustering using PyCaret.
- Implement MeanShift clustering using PyCaret.
- Implement Hierarchical Clustering using PyCaret.

### 3. Visualization
- Plot 3D graphs to visualize the clusters generated by each algorithm.
- Save the plots in the `plots/` directory.

## Running the Code
1. Open `clustering_assignment.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Execute each cell in the notebook to run the code.
3. The notebook will generate plots and display the results of each clustering algorithm.

## Results
- K-means clustering: [Silhouette=0.6923]
- MeanShift clustering: [Silhouette=0.8118]
- Hierarchical Clustering: [Silhouette=0.6776]

## Conclusion
In this assignment, we implemented three clustering algorithms (K-means, MeanShift, Hierarchical Clustering) using PyCaret and visualized the clusters using 3D graphs. Each algorithm generated distinct clusters, and further analysis can be done to interpret and evaluate the results.
